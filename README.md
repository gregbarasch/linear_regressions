# Linear Regressions

This repository features several jupyter notebooks demonstrating several techniques used in solving linear
regression problems, implemented from scratch. 

The techniques featured include:
1. closed form linear regression
2. locally weighted linear regression
3. sfolds cross-validation
4. batch gradient descent

This repo is quick n dirty, but it paints the picture.
